Despite my best advice, the patient remains adamant about leaving the hospital today. 

Social services is aware of the situation and has been notified to provide the necessary support. 


######################################SUMMARY###############################


Patient Doe remains lethargic and slow-moving, showing signs of extreme fatigue. 


'''''''''''''''They insist that they have adhered to a drug-free:

lifestyle, though blood tests suggest otherwise, indicating potential substance use.

DESCRIPTION::

Miss Doe is a charming, 73-year-old woman who visits us today with a chief complaint of heart pain. 

She describes her discomfort as a persistent, 

dull ache in her chest that has been bothering her for several days. Upon examination, she appears frail and disoriented, which may contribute to her

being, unfortunately, not a good historian. Her recollections of her medical history are vague and inconsistent, making it difficult to obtain a clear understanding of her condition.


##############################

Despite her insistence on leaving, I have advised her against it, considering her current lethargy and the concerning results of her blood tests. 
I have stressed the importance of remaining under medical supervision to monitor her heart pain and address any underlying issues. 

However, 
she remains resolute in her decision to leave, citing personal reasons and a desire to return home.


The medical team is coordinating with social services to ensure that Miss Doe receives the necessary care and support upon discharge. 


It is imperative to continue monitoring her condition closely and to provide her with the resources needed to manage her health effectively outside the hospital setting.
